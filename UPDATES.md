## ‚úÖ RateLimitGuard (Redis-based)

### Summary
Rewrote the legacy in-memory rate limiter using Redis to ensure scalability, performance, and security in distributed environments.

### Issues in Original Implementation
- Used in-memory object for tracking requests ‚Üí not scalable
- Raw IPs stored ‚Üí privacy/security issue
- Memory grew indefinitely ‚Üí no cleanup
- Filter logic on arrays ‚Üí inefficient
- Rate-limit decorator didn‚Äôt work
- No central config or testing flexibility

### Improvements Made
- ‚úÖ Replaced in-memory logic with Redis (via central RedisProvider)
- ‚úÖ Added SHA-256 hashing of IP addresses to anonymize and secure identifiers
- ‚úÖ Used Redis `INCR` and `EXPIRE` for atomic request counting and TTL
- ‚úÖ Added functional `@RateLimit(limit, windowMs)` decorator using Reflector
- ‚úÖ Sanitized error messages, removed internal details and raw IPs
- ‚úÖ Centralized config and scalable logic usable across services
- ‚úÖ Final code supports production-grade rate limiting in multi-instance environments

## ‚úÖ RolesGuard Enhancements

### üìÑ File: `src/common/guards/role.guard.ts`

### ‚ùå Problems with Original Code

- No validation if `user` or `user.role` is undefined.
- Returns `false` silently ‚Äî leads to ambiguous access denial.
- No logging or exceptions for unauthorized access.
- No extensibility or helpful error messages.

### ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

- Added `ForbiddenException` with meaningful messages for missing or unauthorized roles.
- Added type annotation for request (`Request` from Express).
- Enhanced logic to allow graceful fallback if roles are not required.
- Improved readability and guard structure.

### üîê Why This Matters

- Proper error messages improve debugging and API consumer experience.
- Cleaner, extensible code allows adding advanced role-based logic in the future (e.g., hierarchical roles, permissions).

### ‚úÖ HttpExceptionFilter Improvements

**Original Issues:**
- Did not differentiate between client-side and server-side errors in logs.
- Could leak sensitive stack traces or internal exception details in responses.
- Error formatting was inconsistent and simplistic.
- Lacked clear, structured logging for debugging.

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Added checks to parse both string and object responses from `exception.getResponse()`.
- Used `warn` for 4xx client errors and `error` for 5xx server errors in logging.
- Ensured the error response structure is clean, consistent, and contains:
  - `success`
  - `statusCode`
  - `timestamp`
  - `path`
  - `message`
- Prevented exposure of stack traces in responses.

**Benefits:**
- Developers and DevOps can quickly identify and differentiate error types from logs.
- Safer, consistent API responses for frontend consumers.
- Clean separation of concerns: logs are verbose, responses are minimal.
